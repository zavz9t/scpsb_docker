# Dockerized serey_cp_support_bot project

## Usage

* Add the following lines to your `.bashrc` file:

```sh
export UID
export GID=$(id -g)
```

* Create Docker pre-existing network:

```sh
docker network create scpsb-network
```

> Find out more [here][0] about pre-existing networks.

* Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` file and fill your local config

* Run containers:

There two ways to run these components:

- by docker-compose (prod) `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`
- by [docker-sync][1] (dev with code synchronization) `docker-sync-stack start`

> **Tip**
> Some containers map ports to a host port somewhere within an ephemeral port range in order to prevent the port
> collisions with already open ports, use command [docker port][3] to get the list port mappings. Find out more
> [here][3] about port bindings.

Enjoy!
